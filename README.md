# Vite Sunk Cost Game

This is smart contract written in solidity++ for a game similar to Fomo3D on the Vite Blockchain.

Any user can start a game with the required amount and state the conditions for the game. 
Subsequent buy-ins are then more expensive. At the end the winner takes all the money.
Pretty Interesting.

## Setup
Clone the project and run `yarn` in the project folder to install the required packages.

Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.vite.org/vite-docs/tutorial/sppguide/introduction/installation.html#deploying-your-first-contract) 
to install the Soliditypp VSCode extension and deploy the contract.

## Tests
Run `yarn test` to run the tests for the contract.
